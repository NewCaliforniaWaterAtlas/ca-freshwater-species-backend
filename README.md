=============================

API and database server for California Freshwater Species project.

## Installation

Development is being carried out with Python 2.7.X. (3.4.X, immediately failed because `petl` does not have Python 3
support.) All other requirements should have been specified in `requirements.txt`.

Create a virtual environment for the project, then run `pip`:

```
pyvenv env_ncwa_fs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
